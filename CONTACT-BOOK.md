# Contact Book (C++)

# Overview

The Contact Book is a C++ program that allows users to store, search, update, and delete contacts.
Each contact contains a name, phone number, and email address. The program uses a Linked List to manage contacts in memory and keeps them sorted alphabetically by name.

Contacts are also stored in a file (contacts.txt) so that the data is not lost when the program exits.

This project demonstrates the use of self-referential structures, dynamic memory, linked lists, and file handling.
